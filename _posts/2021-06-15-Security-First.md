**Hello everyone**,

I'd like to suggest two amazing apps that can help you managing your accounts and 2FA codes.
The first one is **Aegis**: this app helps you managing your 2FA enabled accounts with a really simple UI and without sharing your data with anyone else. You can enabled encrypted backups and the layout customization is a nice addition. Aegis is **open-source** and you can get it here:
<br/>
<a href="https://getaegis.app/" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" role="link">Get Aegis</a>
<br/>
<br/>

**BitWarden** is an **open-source password management service** which passed different security audits and it's available on many devices through web apps, browser extensions, desktop apps and mobile apps. You can take advantage of their cloud services [for free](https://bitwarden.com/pricing/business/) but the Teams plan is really cheap and offers additional features like 2FA through YubiKey or U2F. You can even self-host your server or use the app exclusively offline (though I prefer **KeePass** in that case).
<br/>
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" role="link">Get BitWarden</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Always remember to choose a **strong and robust master password** for your main account and **enable 2FA whenever is possible**.

See you next time!<br/>
